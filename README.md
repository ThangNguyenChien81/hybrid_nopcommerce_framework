# Nopcommerce Automation Framework


## This repository contains the practice files used throughout the courses that are part of the Fullstack Selenium in Java

This project is an example that was built an Automation Framework from scratch.
Every part of this project is sample code that guided me on how to do the following:

* Initial Structure
* Base-Object Pattern
* Factory Pattern
* Multiple Browser support
* Page Navigation 
* Dynamic Locator
* ...and more

## Known issues (Work in progress)
This framework is still ongoing. The Fullstack Selenium in Java course has not been completed yet.
